1. Cleaning the data involved creating an informative print report, viewing where my missing values for respective collumns were, and verifying there weren't any duplicates.
2. I then decided to explore feature engineering techniques Combining all area/Sqft columns, dropping and replacing with a "TotalArea"/"TotalSqft" column.
